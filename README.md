# hello-world
Thank you for creating this tutorial, I am finding my way around.

Since this is a public area (I think) it would make sense to say Hi to anyone who finds this by accident,
actually is that really possible? I seem to remember viewing someone's readme.md file and wondering why anyone
would create such a file .... but Ah-HA I now know their motivation ....
It is the same as mine I have been invited to introduce myself.

Lets see if we can save what I have written so far
There is a likely button above, it is an icon - clipboard with a left pointing "in" arrow.
Maybe I should try that first.  No.. checking back with the tutorial it tells me to use the Commit Changes button

Having fixed some typos ...
Let me introduce myself. Its John at this end I am an electronics proffessional currently on vacation from my design job. One of my hobbies is ham radio - so my choice of radiojohn as a user name

I am very interested in Project Solid at MIT and hope to use GitHub as a means of learning more, who knows I migh end up helping in some small way, being a ham radio enthusiast I am used to bashing away on a keyboard hoping that somebody might be able to hear the signals from my radio teletype (all be it some years ago now, I admit)

Anyway back to the tutorial.
Step 4
Says Open a Pull request .... so I shall try.
